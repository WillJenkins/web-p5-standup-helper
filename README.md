## This is a standup helper.
You can use it to pick random team members to give their update during a daily standup, roundtable discussion, icebreaker, whatever you want!

### Players:
  - All people listed in the players section will be randomized and one by one will be selected to give their update.
  - List each player on their own line in the input text area.

### Final Round:
  - Anyone placed in the final round section will not be on deck until all the players have gone.
  - This is ususally a good place for managers and directors, or anyone you want to go last.

### Gameplay:
  - The list of players is randomized and placed around the play zone.
  - All players will bounce around in the play zone.
  - Two players are selected right at the start.
  - The player shown in blue at the top is the player that is on deck! Time to give your update!
  - The player shown below the current player is going to be up next.

### Next Player:
  - The current player will be removed from the round
  - The player in the 'up-next' position is moved to the Hero position to give their update.
  - Selects the person at the very top of the play zone screen to be added to the 'up next' position.

### Parking lot items (+PL):
  - Add anyting you want to discuss further after the round is complete.
  - If you click +PL the current player's name will be added to the parking lot area.

### Reset:
  - Takes you back to the startup page and maintains the previous game setup. 
  - Note!! This will fully reset the game in-progress and re-randomize all players.

### Send Back:
  - Places the current player on deck at the bottom of the play screen. (Useful for people running late)
  - This does not change the order of final bosses unless they are already in the play zone.

### Hope you like it! <3
