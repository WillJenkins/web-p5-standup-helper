Project still in progress. 

This is a standup helper.
You can use it to pick random team members to give their update during a daily standup, roundtable discussion, icebreaker, whatever you want!

Players:
  All people listed in the players section will be randomized and one by one will be selected to give their update.
  List each player on their own line in the input text area.

Final Bosses:
  Anyone placed in the final boss section will not be on deck until all the players have gone.
  This is ususally a good place for managers and directors, or anyone you want to go last.

Gameplay:
  The list of players is randomized (you can't see the order). 
  All players will bounce around in the play zone.
  Two players are selected right at the start.
  The player shown in blue at the top is the player that is on deck! Time to give your update!
  The player shown below the current player is going to be up next.

Next Player:
  Selects the next person from the randomized list.

Parking lot items (+PL):
  Add anyting you want to discuss further. If you click +PL the current player's name will be added to the parking lot area.

Reset:
  Takes you back to the startup page and maintains the previous game setup. 
  Note!! This will fully reset the game in-progress and re-randomize all players.

Send Back:
  Places the current player on deck at the end of the list. (Useful for people running late)
  This does not change the order of final bosses unless they are already in the play zone.

Hope you like it!
